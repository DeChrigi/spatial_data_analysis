## Python Basic GIS Functionality

This section covers the basic Geographic Information System (GIS) functionalities in Python. It includes topics such as reading and writing spatial data, spatial data manipulation, and spatial data visualization.

## Python Geocoding Addresses

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates. This section explains how to use Python libraries like Geopy to geocode addresses, which can then be used for spatial analysis or mapping.

## Python Nearest Neighbor Analysis

Nearest neighbor analysis is a technique used in spatial statistics to measure distances between points. This section covers how to perform nearest neighbor analysis in Python, which can be useful for tasks like clustering or outlier detection.

## Python Catchment Area Analysis

Catchment area analysis involves determining the area from which a particular location draws resources or customers. This section discusses how to perform catchment area analysis in Python, which can be useful in fields like hydrology or retail location planning.

## Python GWR Data

GWR (Geb√§ude- und Wohnungsregister) data is the most comprehensive dataset about buildings in Switzerland. It contains detailed information about the characteristics of buildings and their use. This section covers how to work with GWR data in Python, including how to read, clean, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights.

## Python Raster Data

Raster data is a type of spatial data that represents a matrix of cells or pixels. This section discusses how to work with raster data in Python, including how to read, write, and manipulate raster data, and how to perform raster-based spatial analysis.

## Python PostgreSQL & PostGIS

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system. PostGIS is a PostgreSQL extension that adds support for geographic objects, allowing location queries to be run in SQL. This section covers how to use Python to interact with PostgreSQL and PostGIS, including how to run spatial queries and how to read and write spatial data.
